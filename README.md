# Extracting products
 
The task for this project was to create a model that is able to extract products from Furniture Stores. Since there is no data set for this specific task, I had to collect data and build my own data set from scratch. I approached this project as NER one and I fine tuned a BERT transformer to predict if a sentence is the name of a furniture object or not.
